# PaintBoy
A goofy off-brand, handheld port of MS Paint for the actual Nintendo Game Boy (DMG). Written starting from nothing, entirely in Z80 assembly!

## Planned Features
- Game Boy Printer Support
- Paint in colors! (GBC Only)

Warning: This is probably *not* a paragon of perfect Game Boy assembly programming. It's hyper-commented, probably slightly inconsistent, and I'm still working to figure out a style that works best for me. The motive of this project is to get back in the saddle by producing *something* simply, quickly. Over time the code will get cleaner and nicer.
